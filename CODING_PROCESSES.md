|                            | Coding process                                | source image                        | Operation                                           | Encoding                                           | Scan components                                             | Type of scan                          |
|----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| Baseline process           | DCT-based                                     | 8-bit samples within each component | Sequential                                          | Huffman coding: 2 AC and 2 DC tables               | Decoders shall process scans with 1,2, 3, and 4 components  | interleaved and non-interleaved scans |
| Extended DCT-based process | DCT-based                                     | 8-bit or 12-bit samples             | Sequential or progressive                           | Huffman or arithmetic coding: 4 AC and 4 DC tables | Decoders shall process scans with 1, 2, 3, and 4 components | interleaved and non-interleaved scans |                                       |
| Lossless processes         | Predictive process                            | P-bit samples (1 < P < 17)          | Sequential                                          | Huffman or arithmetic coding: 4 DC tables          | Decoders shall process scans with 1, 2, 3, and 4 components | interleaved and non-interleaved scans |
| Hierarchical processes     | uses extended DCT-based or lossless processes |                                     | Multiple frames (non-differential and differential) |                                                    | Decoders shall process scans with 1, 2, 3, and 4 components | interleaved and non-interleaved scans |
